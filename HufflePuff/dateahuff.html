      <h1 class="center header">Top 5 Reasons to Date a Hufflepuff</h1>
      <p class="center">So you're considering dating a Hufflepuff, eh?  Great choice.  Not only are Hufflepuffs amongst the least evil of all Wizards, they also make great life-long companions.  Here's a quick list of the top five reasons you should date a Puff.</p>
      
      <h2 class="center header">#5 - They're down to Earth</h2>
      <p class="center">You won't often find a Hufflepuff bragging about their most recent exploits, and not because they have so few.  Hufflepuffs are naturally humble and when they brag it is in celebration with friends.</p>

      <h3 class="center header">#4 - They're Loyal</h3>
      <p class="center">Much like the badger that dawns their crest, Hufflepuffs will do anything to protect their own.  They are loyal almost to a fault, but don't let that turn you off!</p>
